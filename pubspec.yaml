# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/icon/ppc-icon-256.png
    - assets/icon/ppc-icon-48.png
    - assets/icon/ppc-icon-white-256.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  #fonts:
  #  - family: Red Hat Text
  #    fonts:
  #     - asset: fonts/RedHatText-Regular.ttf
  #     - asset: fonts/RedHatText-Bold.ttf
  #     - asset: fonts/RedHatText-Italic.ttf
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
